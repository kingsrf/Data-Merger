PROJECT TITLE: Data Merger

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This project demonstrates how to efficiently merge 
                    two sorted customer data arrays into a single sorted array, 
                    in-place, without using extra memory.
                    It simulates real-world data consolidation tasks 
                    often performed in data analytics and 
                    market research companies.
